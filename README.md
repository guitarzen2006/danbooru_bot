# Danbooru Bot - A simple anime/manga pic grabber for Discord

This is one of my first attempts at creating a chat bot for discord. As a fan of various anime and manga I have created a simple chatbot for discord to pull pictures from the [safebooru.donmai.us](https://safebooru.donmai.us) wiki which has a simple API and thousands of posts from various professional and amatuer artists. Documentation on their API can be found here: https://safebooru.donmai.us/wiki_pages/help:api 

Please note that safebooru is a default safe search, the actual site is [danbooru.donmai.us](https://danbooru.donmai.us). However the content at that site is too explicit for my taste and I do not recommend it for general use.

# How I Run the Chatbot

The chatbot's script is ran as a docker container on a virtualized device in the cloud.
